Based on the analysis, polynomial regression is a suitable model for predicting CO2 production, providing a high degree of accuracy and efficiency in capturing the non-linear relationships between the variables. With its ability to handle complex relationships and provide accurate predictions, polynomial regression is a reliable choice for modeling CO2 production data, enabling informed decisions to be made about strategies for reducing carbon emissions.
